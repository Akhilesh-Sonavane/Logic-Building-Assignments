## 🔧 Programs Summary

✅ program1.java
Description:
Prints a square pattern with # on the diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) and * elsewhere.

Example Output (4x4):

*	*	*	#	

*	*	#	*	

*	#	*	*	

#	*	*	*	

✅ program2.java
Description:
Prints a square pattern with # on the diagonal (top-right to bottom-left), @ below the diagonal, and * above the diagonal.

Example Output (4x4):

*	*	*	#	

*	*	#	@	

*	#	@	@	

#	@	@	@	

✅ program3.java
Description:
Prints a square pattern with * on the border (first/last rows and columns) and diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), spaces elsewhere.

Example Output (5x5):

*	*	*	*	*	

*	*			*	

*		*		*	

*			*	*	

*	*	*	*	*	

✅ program4.java
Description:
Prints a square pattern with * on the border and diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), $ below the diagonal, and # above the diagonal.

Example Output (5x5):

*	*	*	*	*	

*	*	#	#	*	

*	$	*	#	*	

*	$	$	*	*	

*	*	*	*	*	

✅ program5.java
Description:
Prints a square pattern of integers with numbers printed on the border and diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), spaces elsewhere.

Example Output (5x5):

1	2	3	4	5	

1	2			5	

1		3		5	

1			4	5
