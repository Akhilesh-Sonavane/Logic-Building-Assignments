    * Functions:
        * `CircleArea(float fRadius)`: Calculates the area of the circle.
        * `main()`:  Prompts the user for the radius, calls `CircleArea`, and prints the calculated area.

2.  **program2_rectangle_area.c:**
    * Description: Accepts the width and height (floats) of a rectangle as input and calculates its area.
    * Author: Akhilesh.P.Sonavane
    * Date: 17/05/2025
    * Functions:
        * `RectArea(float fWidth, float fHeight)`: Calculates the area of the rectangle.
        * `main()`: Prompts the user for the width and height, calls `RectArea`, and prints the calculated area.

3.  **program3_km_to_meter.c:**
    * Description: Converts a distance from kilometers (km) to meters.
    * Author: Akhilesh.P.Sonavane
    * Date: 17/05/2025
    * Functions:
        * `KMtoMeter(int iNo)`: Performs the kilometer to meter conversion.
        * `main()`: Prompts the user for the distance in kilometers, calls `KMtoMeter`, and prints the equivalent distance in meters.

4.  **program4_fahrenheit_to_celsius.c:**
    * Description: Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
    * Author: Akhilesh.P.Sonavane
    * Date: 17/05/2025
    * Functions:
        * `FhtoCs(float fTemp)`: Performs the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion.
        * `main()`: Prompts the user for the temperature in Fahrenheit, calls `FhtoCs`, and prints the equivalent temperature in Celsius.

5.  **program5_sqfeet_to_sqmeter.c:**
    * Description: Converts an area from square feet to square meters.
    * Author: Akhilesh.P.Sonavane
    * Date: 17/05/2025
    * Functions:
        * `SquareMeter(int iValue)`: Performs the square feet to square meters conversion.
