# Assignment 12 - Pattern Printing in Java

This assignment contains five Java programs, each designed to demonstrate different ways to display patterns using loops and conditionals. The programs use object-oriented principles and take user input for the number of rows and columns.

## 🔧 Programs Summary

### ✅ program1.java
**Description**: Accepts a number of rows and columns, and prints a grid of `*` symbols.
```
Example:
Input: Rows = 3, Columns = 4
Output:
*	*	*	*
*	*	*	*
*	*	*	*
```

---

### ✅ program2.java
**Description**: Accepts rows and columns and prints a pattern of column-wise integers starting from 1.
```
Example:
Input: Rows = 3, Columns = 4
Output:
1	2	3	4
1	2	3	4
1	2	3	4
```

---

### ✅ program3.java
**Description**: Accepts rows and columns and prints each row in decreasing order starting from column count.
```
Example:
Input: Rows = 3, Columns = 4
Output:
4	3	2	1
4	3	2	1
4	3	2	1
```

---

### ✅ program4.java
**Description**: Prints a pattern of alternating `*` and `#` based on whether the column index is even or odd, in reverse order.
```
Example:
Input: Rows = 2, Columns = 5
Output:
#	*	#	*	#
#	*	#	*	#
```

---

### ✅ program5.java
**Description**: Prints each row with the row number repeated in reverse column order.
```
Example:
Input: Rows = 3, Columns = 4
Output:
1	1	1	1
2	2	2	2
3	3	3	3
```

## 🛠️ How to Run
Compile and run each program using:

```bash
javac programX.java
java programX
```
(Replace `X` with 1 to 5 depending on the file.)
