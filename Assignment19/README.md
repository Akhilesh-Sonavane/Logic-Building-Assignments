# Java Programs Collection

This repository contains a new set of Java programs focusing on integer array processing, such as counting even elements, finding frequency, and specific element searches. These programs are ideal for strengthening array manipulation and conditional logic in Java.

## Contents

### 1. program1.java - Count Frequency of Even Elements
- **Description**: Accepts N integers and returns the count of even numbers in the array.
- **Concepts Used**: Array traversal, modulus operation, counter logic.

---

### 2. program2.java - Difference Between Even and Odd Frequencies
- **Description**: Accepts N integers and returns the difference between even and odd number frequencies.
- **Concepts Used**: Conditional logic, counters, array traversal.

---

### 3. program3.java - Check Presence of 11 in Array
- **Description**: Checks whether the number 11 is present in the entered array elements.
- **Concepts Used**: Boolean flag, search operation in array.

---

### 4. program4.java - First Occurrence Index of 11
- **Description**: Finds the first index (1-based) at which 11 appears in the array.
- **Concepts Used**: Conditional checks, loop traversal with break statement.

---

### 5. program5.java - First Occurrence Index of User-Specified Element
- **Description**: Accepts N integers and an additional number; returns its first occurrence index (1-based) if present.
- **Concepts Used**: Looping, comparison, early termination (break).

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac program1.java
   ```

2. **Run**:
   ```bash
   java program1
   ```

Repeat the same steps for `program2.java` to `program5.java`.
