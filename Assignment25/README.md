# Java Character Array String Manipulations

This repository includes a collection of Java programs that demonstrate character array handling, string conversions, and manipulations such as case transformation, digit extraction, toggling cases, and whitespace counting. These programs are useful for understanding low-level string processing in Java.

## Contents

## 1. program1.java – Convert to Lowercase
**Description**: Accepts a character array, converts it into a string, and prints the lowercase version of the string.
**Concepts Used**: ASCII value manipulation, condition checking, loops.
**Usage**: Demonstrates conversion of uppercase letters to lowercase without using built-in methods.
---
## 2. program2.java – Convert to Uppercase
**Description**: Accepts a character array, converts it into a string, and prints the uppercase version of the string.
**Concepts Used**: ASCII manipulation, conditional statements, character arrays.
**Usage**: Illustrates how lowercase characters are converted to uppercase manually.
---
## 3. program3.java – Toggle Case
**Description**: Accepts a character array, converts it into a string, and prints the toggled version of each character (uppercase to lowercase and vice versa).
**Concepts Used**: ASCII math, character checking, loops.
**Usage**: Highlights case toggling logic character by character.
---
## 4. program4.java – Extract Digits
**Description**: Accepts a character array, converts it into a string, and prints only the digits present in the input.
**Concepts Used**: Character checking, ASCII range for digits.
**Usage**: Filters and displays digits from a string.
---
## 5. program5.java – Count Whitespaces
**Description**: Accepts a character array, converts it into a string, and counts the number of whitespace characters.
**Concepts Used**: ASCII checking for space, counters, and iteration.
**Usage**: Useful for determining how many spaces are present in a sentence.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac program1.java
   ```

2. **Run**:
   ```bash
   java program1
   ```

Repeat the same for the other files by changing the filename.
