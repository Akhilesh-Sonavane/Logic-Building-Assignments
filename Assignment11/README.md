### ✅ `program3.java`
- **Functionality:** Accepts a positive number and converts it to a negative number using simple arithmetic.
- **Example:**
  ```
  Input: 25
  Output: -25
  ```

---

### ✅ `program4.java`
- **Functionality:** Prints a pattern where odd-numbered rows contain positive numbers and even-numbered rows contain negative numbers.
- **Example (Input: 4 rows, 4 columns):**
  ```
  -1 -2 -3 -4
   1  2  3  4
  -1 -2 -3 -4
   1  2  3  4
  ```

---

### ✅ `program5.java`
- **Functionality:** Prints a pattern with increasing numbers in each row, starting from the row index.
- **Example (Input: 4 rows, 4 columns):**
  ```
  1 2 3 4
  2 3 4 5
  3 4 5 6
  4 5 6 7
  ```
