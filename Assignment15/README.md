## 🔧 Programs Summary

✅ program1.java
Description:
Prints a pattern of stars (*) and hashes (#) in a square matrix, where stars fill the lower-left triangle including the diagonal, and hashes fill the upper-right part.

Example Output (4x4):

markdown
Copy code
*	#	#	#	

*	*	#	#	

*	*	*	#	

*	*	*	*	

✅ program2.java
Description:
Prints a pattern of stars (*) and hashes (#) in a square matrix, but stars fill the upper-left triangle including the diagonal from the top-right corner, and hashes fill the remaining part.

Example Output (4x4):

markdown
Copy code
*	*	*	*	

*	*	*	#	

*	*	#	#	

*	#	#	#	

✅ program3.java
Description:
Prints a pattern of stars (*) with a diagonal of dollar signs ($) from the top-left to bottom-right.

Example Output (4x4):

$	*	*	*	

*	$	*	*	

*	*	$	*	

*	*	*	$	

✅ program4.java
Description:
Prints a square pattern where the border is filled with stars (*) and the inside is filled with at signs (@).

Example Output (4x4):

*	*	*	*	

*	@	@	*	

*	@	@	*	

*	*	*	*	

✅ program5.java
Description:
Prints a pattern where the border contains the column numbers and the inside is filled with stars (*).

Example Output (4x4):

1	2	3	4
