# Java Character Classification Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic Java programs focused on character classification and simple decision-making logic using conditional constructs. These programs are designed for beginners in Java programming to understand ASCII-based validation and control flow.

## Contents

### 1. program1.java - Display Full ASCII Table
- **Description**: Displays the full ASCII table from 0 to 127, including control characters.
- **Concepts Used**: Loops, ASCII values, typecasting, arrays.
- **Usage**: Helps understand character representations using their decimal values.

### 2. program2.java - Character Case Conversion
- **Description**: Accepts a character and converts it from lowercase to uppercase or vice versa.
- **Concepts Used**: Character manipulation, ASCII arithmetic, conditional logic.
- **Usage**: Demonstrates how to toggle character case using ASCII differences.

### 3. program3.java - Display Incremented Character Range
- **Description**: Accepts a character and prints all characters incrementing till 'Z' if uppercase, and decrementing     till 'a' if lowercase.
- **Concepts Used**: Looping, ASCII value comparison, conditional logic.
- **Usage**: Useful for understanding character sequences in the alphabet using ASCII ordering.

### 4. program4.java - Special Character Detection
- **Description**: Accepts a character array, converts it to a string, and checks for the presence of special characters.
- **Concepts Used**: ASCII validation, logical operators, boolean flagging.
- **Usage**: Helps identify if the input contains only alphanumeric characters or special symbols.

### 5. program5.java - ASCII Conversion to Decimal, Octal, and Hexadecimal
- **Description**: Accepts a character and converts it to Decimal, Octal, and Hexadecimal format without using built-in conversion methods.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac program1.java
   ```

2. **Run**:
   ```bash
   java program1
   ```

Repeat the same for the other files by changing the filename.
