# Assignment 16 - Pattern Printing in Java

This assignment contains five Java programs, each designed to demonstrate different ways to display patterns using loops and conditionals. The programs use object-oriented principles and take user input for the number of rows and columns.

## 🔧 Programs Summary

✅ program1.java
Description:
Prints a left-aligned right-angled triangle pattern of * where the number of * in each row equals the row number.

Example Output (4x4):

*		

*	*		

*	*	*		

*	*	*	*		

✅ program2.java
Description:
Prints a right-aligned right-angled triangle pattern of * starting from the full row of stars and decreasing by one star each row.

Example Output (4x4):

*	*	*	*		

	*	*	*		

		*	*		

			*	

✅ program3.java
Description:
Prints a square pattern with $ on the diagonal, # below the diagonal, and * above the diagonal.

Example Output (4x4):

$	*	*	*		

#	$	*	*		

#	#	$	*		

#	#	#	$	

✅ program4.java
Description:
Prints a pattern with * on the border (first and last row, first and last column) and on the diagonal, spaces elsewhere.

Example Output (5x5):

*	*	*	*	*	*	

*	  *				*		

*		  *			*		

*			  *		*		

*	*	*	*	*	*	

✅ program5.java
Description:
Prints a pattern of integers aligned in a left-angled triangle but printed in reverse row order, with numbers incrementing from 1 on each row.

Example Output (4x4):

1		

1	2		

1	2	3		

1	2	3	4

Compile and run each program using:

```bash
javac programX.java
java programX
```
(Replace `X` with 1 to 5 depending on the file.)
