# Assignment 14 - Pattern Printing in Java

This assignment contains five Java programs, each designed to demonstrate different ways to display patterns using loops and conditionals. The programs use object-oriented principles and take user input for the number of rows and columns.

## 🔧 Programs Summary

✅ program1.java
Description:
Prints an integer pattern starting from 1 to 9 repeatedly in a grid of rows and columns.

Example Output (3x5):

Copy code
1	2	3	4	5

6	7	8	9	1

2	3	4	5	6

✅ program2.java
Description:
Prints a pattern where odd rows display even numbers and even rows display odd numbers up to twice the column count.

Example Output (3x4):

Copy code
2	4	6	8	

1	3	5	7	

2	4	6	8	

✅ program3.java
Description:
Prints a mixed pattern where odd rows display consecutive lowercase letters from 'a' and even rows display consecutive numbers starting from 1.

Example Output (3x4):

css
Copy code
a	b	c	d	

1	2	3	4	

a	b	c	d	

✅ program4.java
Description:
Prints a pattern where odd rows contain positive numbers and even rows contain their negative counterparts, both increasing from 1 to the number of columns.

Example Output (3x4):

diff
Copy code
1	2	3	4	

-1	-2	-3	-4	

1	2	3	4	

✅ program5.java
Description:
Prints a pattern of increasing integers for each row where each number is the sum of the row index and column offset.

Example Output (3x4):

Copy code
1	2	3	4	

2	3	4	5	

3	4	5	6
