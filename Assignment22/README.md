# Java Character Classification Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic Java programs focused on character classification and simple decision-making logic using conditional constructs. These programs are designed for beginners in Java programming to understand ASCII-based validation and control flow.

## Contents

### 1. program1.java - Check if Character is Alphabet
- **Description**: Accepts a character input and checks whether it is an English alphabet (either uppercase or lowercase).
- **Concepts Used**: ASCII range check, logical OR operator, conditional branching.
- **Usage**: Helps determine if the input is a letter.

---

### 2. program2.java - Check for Uppercase Character
- **Description**: Accepts a character input and checks whether it is an uppercase letter (A–Z).
- **Concepts Used**: ASCII upper-case validation using range checking.
- **Usage**: Useful for form validation and input filters.

---

### 3. program3.java - Check for Digit
- **Description**: Accepts a character and checks whether it is a digit (0–9).
- **Concepts Used**: ASCII digit range check.
- **Usage**: Ensures numeric-only character input.

---

### 4. program4.java - Check for Lowercase Character
- **Description**: Accepts a character and checks whether it is a lowercase letter (a–z).
- **Concepts Used**: ASCII lowercase range check.
- **Usage**: Useful in scenarios requiring case-sensitive validations.

---

### 5. program5.java - Division-Wise Exam Schedule
- **Description**: Accepts a division character (A-D/a-d) and prints the exam schedule based on division.
- **Concepts Used**: If-Else conditional branching, character comparison.
- **Usage**: Simple example of multi-condition decision handling.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac program1.java
   ```

2. **Run**:
   ```bash
   java program1
   ```

Repeat the same for the other files by changing the filename.
