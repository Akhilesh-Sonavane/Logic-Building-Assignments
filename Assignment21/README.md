# Java Programs Collection (Array Operations)

This repository contains a set of basic Java programs focused on array manipulations and number operations such as finding minimum/maximum values, digit summation, and filtering based on conditions. These programs are ideal for beginners learning Java through practical examples.

## Contents

### 1. program1.java - Maximum Value from Array
- **Description**: Accepts N integers and returns the maximum value among them.
- **Concepts Used**: Arrays, loops, condition checking.
- **Usage**: Helps understand how to traverse an array to identify the maximum value.

---

### 2. program2.java - Minimum Value from Array
- **Description**: Accepts N integers and returns the minimum value among them.
- **Concepts Used**: Arrays, loops, condition checking.
- **Usage**: Demonstrates the logic to determine the smallest number in an array.

---

### 3. program3.java - Difference Between Max and Min
- **Description**: Accepts N integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum value.
- **Concepts Used**: Arrays, finding max/min values, arithmetic operation.
- **Usage**: Combines array traversal with logical comparison and math.

---

### 4. program4.java - Display Three-Digit Numbers
- **Description**: Accepts N integers and prints only those that are three-digit numbers.
- **Concepts Used**: Conditional logic with arrays.
- **Usage**: Filters specific elements from an array based on criteria.

---

### 5. program5.java - Digit Summation of Array Elements
- **Description**: Accepts N integers and displays the sum of digits for each individual element.
- **Concepts Used**: Loops, number manipulation, digit extraction using modulo/division.
- **Usage**: Reinforces number breakdown and digit-wise processing in Java.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac program1.java
   ```

2. **Run**:
   ```bash
   java program1
   ```

Repeat the same for the other files by changing the filename.
