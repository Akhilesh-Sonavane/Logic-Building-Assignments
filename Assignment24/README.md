# Java Programs Collection – String and Character Operations

This repository contains a set of Java programs designed to practice string handling and character operations. These programs demonstrate various ways to work with character arrays, string conversions, and counting logic. Ideal for beginners and academic practice.

## Contents

### 1. program1.java – Count Capital Characters
- **Description**: Accepts a character array converted from a string and returns the number of capital (uppercase) characters.
- **Concepts Used**: Character array, ASCII value range for uppercase letters, manual counting.

---

### 2. program2.java – Count Small Characters
- **Description**: Accepts a character array converted from a string and returns the number of small (lowercase) characters.
- **Concepts Used**: ASCII value range for lowercase letters, array traversal.

---

### 3. program3.java – Difference Between Capital and Small Characters
- **Description**: Accepts a character array and returns the absolute difference between the count of capital and small characters.
- **Concepts Used**: ASCII checks for both uppercase and lowercase, absolute difference logic.

---

### 4. program4.java – Check for Vowels in String
- **Description**: Accepts a character array from a string and checks if it contains at least one vowel (both upper and lower case).
- **Concepts Used**: Vowel identification, early return optimization.

---

### 5. program5.java – Reverse the String
- **Description**: Accepts a character array and prints the string in reverse order.
- **Concepts Used**: Reverse traversal of array, string manipulation without built-in reverse functions.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac program1.java
   ```

2. **Run**:
   ```bash
   java program1
   ```

Repeat the same for the other files by changing the filename.
