## Java Character & String Manipulation Programs

This repository includes a collection of basic Java programs focused on character search, frequency analysis, indexing, and string reversal. These programs are beginner-friendly and useful for understanding the fundamentals of string and character processing in Java.

## Contents

## 1. program1.java – Character Presence in String
**Description**: Accepts a string and a character; checks whether the character is present in the string.
**Concepts Used**: String traversal, character comparison.
**Usage**: Returns a boolean indicating presence of character.
---
## 2. program2.java – Frequency of Character
**Description**: Accepts a string and a character; returns the frequency of that character in the string.
**Concepts Used**: Counting logic, character arrays, loops.
**Usage**: Displays the number of times a character appears.
---
## 3. program3.java – First Occurrence Index
**Description**: Accepts a string and a character; returns the index of the first occurrence of the character.
**Concepts Used**: Loop with conditional check, index tracking.
**Usage**: Outputs the index or -1 if not found.

## 4. program4.java – Last Occurrence Index
**Description**: Accepts a string and a character; returns the index of the last occurrence of the character.
**Concepts Used**: Reverse index tracking within loop.
**Usage**: Outputs the last position index or -1 if not found.

## 5. program5.java – Reverse String
**Description**: Accepts a string and displays its reverse.
**Concepts Used**: Reverse traversal, character arrays.
**Usage**: Prints the reversed string directly.
