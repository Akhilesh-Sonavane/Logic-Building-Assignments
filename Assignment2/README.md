This folder contains five C programs written by **Akhilesh P. Sonavane** on **10/05/2025**. These programs demonstrate fundamental programming skills in C, including loops, conditionals, and input validation by following industrial coding conventions.

## Contents

1. **program1.c** – Prints asterisks `*` based on the entered number using a while loop.
2. **program2.c** – Similar to program1, prints `*` using a decreasing while loop.
3. **program3.c** – Accepts a number and prints "Hello" if it's less than 10; otherwise, prints "Demo".
4. **program4.c** – Takes a number and a frequency, then prints the number that many times.
5. **program5.c** – Checks whether the entered number is even or odd.

## How to Compile & Run

```bash
gcc program1.c -o program1
./program1
```

Repeat with the respective filenames to run each program.
